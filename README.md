# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Introduction:

For my Front-End Web Development school project, I tackled the common problem of meal planning in my community. The goal was simple: create a user-friendly web app that makes deciding what to cook a breeze.

Main Section:

Identifying the Problem:
I noticed people in my community often struggle with figuring out what to cook every day, leading to decision fatigue. The project aimed to cut through this by developing a straightforward application for easy meal planning.

User-Centered Design:
The focus was on keeping things easy. I went for a clean, modern design to make sure anyone could navigate and use the app without getting lost. The idea was to make it as user-friendly as possible.

Functionality and Interactivity:
The heart of the app is about choosing ingredients and getting random meal suggestions. Users pick ingredients from different categories, and the app does the rest. It's not just practical; it adds a bit of fun to cooking too.

React and Animation:
React was the obvious choice for its simplicity, and I added some smooth animations using React Spring. A subtle fade-in effect on page load and input elements adds a nice touch without overcomplicating things.

Conclusion:

In wrapping up, this project showcases how simple solutions can make a big difference. By focusing on practicality, user-friendliness, and a touch of fun, the end result is a web app that takes the stress out of meal planning in a straightforward way.
